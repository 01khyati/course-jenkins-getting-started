# Jenkins Getting Started

*FYI the update is not yet complete*

- This is an update to my original [`Getting Started with Jenkins 2`](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jenkins-2-getting-started) course.
  - You can follow this link to access the original course which is longer and has some content that wasn't included in the update given that we wanted to shrink the duration for placement into a jenkins learning path. And of course include relevant new features where applicable.
  - FYI the vast majority of content in the 1st edition is still relevant in the latest versions of Jenkins!
- In this update, the `2` is dropped from the title even though I'm still covering the latest version of Jenkins which is still `2`.
