- Course repositories:
  - Given the nature of `Jenkins` there are several repos for this course and to avoid confusion pay close attention to the links below, copy/paste them, don't type them out. So first clone the overview repo with the shortened URL above if you are typing out the link. Then click through to each repo to avoid any mistakes in typing:
  - [spring-petclinic - example notes](docs/spring-petclinic.md)
    - repo: https://github.com/g0t4/jgsu-spring-petclinic
  - https://github.com/jenkins-getting-started/jgsu-spc-jenkinsfile
    - `spring-petclinic` `pipeline` ported to a `Jenkinsfile` in `git`
  - https://github.com/jenkins-getting-started
    - This is a GitHub organization I setup to house several repositories you can scan for with the features I demo at the end of the course.

## 2nd Edition docs/notes

See the [docs](docs) folder for various additional notes I've left for you. Quite a bit of this is stuff not in the course that I wanted to share with you as you get started. Some of it is fodder for learning beyond the course. 

## 1st Edition

- This is an update to my original [`Getting Started with Jenkins 2`](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jenkins-2-getting-started) course.
  - You can follow this link to access the original course which is longer and has some content that wasn't included in the update given that we wanted to shrink the duration for placement into a jenkins learning path. And of course include relevant new features where applicable.
  - FYI the vast majority of content in the 1st edition is still relevant in the latest versions of Jenkins!
- In this update, the `2` is dropped from the title even though I'm still covering the latest version of Jenkins which is still `2`.
- [1st Edition Overview/Resources Gist (https://git.io/vKSVZ)](https://git.io/vKSVZ)
  - I share these mostly to avoid confusion with associated repos and examples that are and will continue to remain accessibly here on GitHub.
- This `Jenkinsfile` highlights a complex pipeline with multiple nodes involved and parallelism, for a challenge try to get this up and running on your own. Or at least read through it and grok what you think is needed to get it working.
