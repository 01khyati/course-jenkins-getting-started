# Jenkins Getting Started

This is an update to my original [`Getting Started with Jenkins 2`](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jenkins-2-getting-started) course.

FYI: The `2` is dropped from the title even though I'm still covering the latest version of Jenkins 2.
- This update also exists to trim some of the content for placement in a learning path. If you also want access to the [full 1st Edition course which is still largely relevant use this direct link](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jenkins-2-getting-started).

## Example repositories

These repos house examples for following along:
- [spring-petclinic](./README.spring-petclinic.md)
- ... MORE COMING SOON ...

## 1st Edition resources

- Don't be confused by resources from the 1st Edition of my `Getting Started with Jenkins 2` course
- [1st Edition Overview (Gist)](https://git.io/vKSVZ)
