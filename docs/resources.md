- Documentation
  - NOTE: often you'll find parts of the jenkins.io docs out of date, most of the time it's not material but it happens and you should be aware that the docs are not always (as is the case in any project) the latest state of the codebase.

  - Authoring `pipeline` scripts:
    - [`Classic UI`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#through-the-classic-ui)
    - [`In SCM`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm)
      - [`Jenkinsfile`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/)
    - [`BlueOcean`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#through-blue-ocean)
      - [`BlueOcean` docs](jenkins.io/doc/book/blueocean/)
      - Official docs list this as separate category but it's really just via SCM + BlueOcean UI generating pipelines
        - Arguably `BlueOcean` was yet another step toward the Freestyle project type... BUT, in terms of a simplified UI for pipelines... interesting to watch popularity drift back and forth as people have needs and are compelled to travel in differnet directions to solve those needs.
      - BlueOcean can generate/scaffold and commit Jenkinsfiles
      - Major dev of BlueOcean has stalled. From what I've read, as of late (2020), the goal is to use BlueOcean "lessons learned" to redesign the Classic UI (in time drastically).
  - **Dynamic** documentation on a running instance, varies with plugins installed
    - [Snippet Generator](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#snippet-generator)
      - <http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/>
      - Form based generation of steps for either a `scripted` or a `declarative` pipeline
    - [Declarative Directive Generator](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#directive-generator)
      - <http://localhost:8080/directive-generator>
      - Form based generation of nested directives (ie `when`)
        - NOT steps
    - [Global Variable Reference](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#global-variable-reference)
      - <http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals>
      - `pipeline` declarative "entrypoint" is a global!
    - [Pipeline As YAML Converter](http://jenkins:18080/job/vcs-spc/payConverter/)
      - Great example of adding a plugin (yaml pipelines) and seeing new docs light up under the [`Pipeline Syntax`](http://jenkins:18080/pipeline-syntax/) section
